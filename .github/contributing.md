# Contributing

> Before submitting a pull request to Remarkable:

1. Run `npm test` to be sure that all tests are passing.
2. Run `node benchmark` to ensure that performance has not degraded.
3. DO NOT include any auto-generated browser or demo files in your commit.
4. Commit to the [dev](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/remarkable/tree/dev) branch, never master.

Thanks!
